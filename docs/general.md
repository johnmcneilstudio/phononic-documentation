# General Settings

> In this section you can configure all the General options of the site that are applied site-wide.
> All the General Settings of the site can be found under the admin menu `Appearance -> Customize`.
> Inside this Section you can find all options separated into different sub-sections. Here are all the sub-sections: 


1. Site Identity
1. Menus
1. Widgets
1. Homepage Settings
1. Script Tags
1. Social Media Icons
1. Additional CSS - Place to add your custom CSS in case you want to override the default CSS for part of the site.


### Site Identity
-------------------

> In this section you can configure all the basic site identity options like Main Logo, Footer Logo, Site Title, etc. 


Head to `Appearance -> Customize` and then choose the `Site Identity` Menu.


Here you have tha ability to change the Site Title and Tagline, along with the site favicon.

The Site favicon can be either a GIF, PNG OR SVG and needs to be at least 512x512 px in size for pixel based image formats like GIF or PNG. SVG doesn't need any specific pixels as it is vector based format.
Of course you can use smaller resolution images like 128x128 or even 64x64 but this will make the logo more blurry and less high resolution for retina screens.

### Menus
-------------------

Here you can set your different menus that are used across the site. Currently we use 5 different menus. 
One is used in the header and it is named `Main Menu` and there are 4 others that are used at the 4 different columns in the footer of the site named `Footer Menu 1-4`

From this section you can create your different menus and you can also configure the menus from `Appearance -> Menus` as well.

From both within the Customizer options or Menus, you can set the order of the menu items or even delete, add or edit a menu item.

### Widgets
--------------------

Widgets are sections across the site where you can add different Widgets to make the site more dynamic.
Currently we use 3 Widgetized areas:

* Footer Main Widget Area (Used to add all WordPress Menus or Widgets that show in the Footer section)
* Sitemap Page Widget Area (Used to add the different widgets used in the Sitemap page)
* Max Mega Menu Widgets (This is where Max Mega Menu stores widgets that you have added to sub menus using the mega menu builder. You can edit existing widgets here, but new widgets must be added through the Mega Menu interface (under Appearance > Menus).)

Please note that you can add pretty much everything there, from static text, images, menu items and other custom widgets.

### Homepage Settings
---------------------

The only option inside this page is to set which page will be served as the Homepage. Currently it is set to the Homepage but if you decide to create a new homepage in the future and set this new page as your Homepage, just head to this section and choose the new page from the dropdown.

### Script Tags
--------------------

In this section you can configure any of the most popular script tags on your site and there is no need to do that with any 3rd party plugin.
This section supports for now the current scripts:

* Google Analytics Tracking Code
* Google Tag Manager Tracking Code
* Facebook Pixel Code

You just have to add only the unique id generated by your service and NOT the whole script tag. So for example for Google Analytics you just have to add `UA-147648636-2` and nothing else.
Everything else is done programmatically.

### Social Media Icons
----------------------


In this section you can set your social media accounts. The only option needed for every social network is the link to your official page.
The social media networks supported are the following ones:

* Facebook
* Vimeo
* Twitter
* Youtube
* Linked in

If you wish to add more social networks, this must be done programmatically as an additional request after hand-off of the project.
Please note that there is a checkbox on this section named `Show Social Media Icons` that means, even if you have your social media network links saved, these will only be visible at the footer of the site if you have this option checked.

### Additional CSS
--------------------


This section is used in case you want to override some CSS of the site and you don't want to mess with theme files.
Due to the reason that the CSS on the site is compiled into a minified version, it is always recommended if you are not a theme developer or WordPress expert in general, to not touch those files.

### Uberflip Settings
----------------------


Use this section to set the titles & icons for uberflip cards (resources). Uberflip cards will look for a matching tag on the item and use the correlated title and icon. The first item in the list is used as the default if no matching tags are found.
