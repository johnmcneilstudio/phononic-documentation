# CSS Methodologies

CSS Methodologies are a set of architectural paradigms that help avoid poor code and embraces clean and meaningful code for smaller and bigger projects

## â–½ ITCSS Architecture

A simple ITCSS folder structure sample.

### What is ITCSS?

> ITCSS stands for _Inverted Triangle CSS_ and it helps you to organize your project CSS files in such way that you can better **deal with** (not always easy-to-deal with) CSS specifics like **global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity**.

It was created by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) and it works very well with methodologies like [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) or [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki).

Check out [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) to see the best example of ITCSS.

![ITCSS Layers](https://i.imgur.com/mRQpvSj.png)

&nbsp;

### Those layers are as follows:

* **Settings** â€“ used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
* **Tools** â€“ globally used mixins and functions. Itâ€™s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
* **Generic** â€“ reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
* **Elements** â€“ styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
* **Objects** â€“ class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
* **Components** â€“ specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
* **Utilities** â€“ utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class

&nbsp;

The triangle also shows how styles represented by selectors are ordered in the resulting CSS: from generic styles to explicit ones, from low-specificity selectors to more specific ones (but still not too specific, IDs are not allowed) and from far reaching to localized ones.

## BEM Naming Methodology
BEMâ€Š-â€ŠBlock Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.

### What is BEM?

BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.
<br />
<br />
The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. Using BEMâ€™s proper naming convention will better prepare you for design changes made to your website.
