## Getting Started

#### ⚡️ Quick Overview

Run step `#1`, `#2`, and `#3` quickly in one go — Run inside local WP install's theme/plugin folder E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin` or `/wp.local/wp-content/themes/your-theme` directory.

```sh
# 1— Install WPGulp in your WordPress theme/plugin.
npx install-wpgulp
# 2— Now configure variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file.
# 3— Start your npm build workflow.
npm start
```

([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/ahmadawais/e4c69b22561c7079c9d99faba90e3b23))

> 🎛   _If you want to study the detailed installation of step `#1` , `#2`,  and `#3` — then take a look at the steps below_.

<br>
<details>
 <summary><strong><code>STEP #0</code></strong> — Don't have <code>Node.js</code> + <code>npm</code> installed? Read this. (CLICK TO EXPAND!)</summary>

In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of `Node.js`, JavaScript, and `npm` packages — all you need to do is go to the Node's site [download + install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node on your system. This will install both `Node.js` and `npm`, i.e., node package manager — the command line interface of Node.js.

You can verify the install by opening your terminal app and typing...

```sh
node -v
# Results into v9.1.0 — make sure you have Node >= 8 installed.

npm -v
# Results into 5.6.0 — make sure you have npm >= 5.3 installed.
```

</details>

### → `STEP #1` — Download the Required Files

1. In the terminal go to the root folder of your WordPress plugin/theme
2. Run the following command to download all the files in the theme folder

_It'll take a couple of minutes to install._

```sh
npx install-wpgulp
```

([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/ahmadawais/e4c69b22561c7079c9d99faba90e3b23))

![wpgulp install gif](https://on.ahmda.ws/e177e70294ca/c)

> ⚠️  I'm assuming that there are no previously present similar files in the root of your folder. Otherwise, you need to merge these very carefully. E.g. You can include the `scripts`, `devDependencies` in your current `pacakge.json` file and so on for other files. If you run the above command all similar files will be overwritten.

### → `STEP #2` — Editing the Project Variables

Configure the project paths and other variables inside the `gulpfile.babel.js` file. This is a compulsory step.

![wpgulp config](https://on.ahmda.ws/f2ca9bb4a740/c)


### → `STEP #3` — Start your project

Once the installation is done, you can open your project (WordPress plugin/theme) folder and run the start script.

```sh
npm start

# To stop press CTRL (⌃) + C
```

![wpgulp start](https://on.ahmda.ws/d64abd87de1f/c)

### → `OPTIONAL STEP #4` — More Scripts/Tasks

To optimize images and generate WP POT translation file, or generate a RTL stylesheet you can run the following commands

```sh
# To optimize images
gulp images

# To generate WP POT translation file.
gulp translate

# To generate RTL stylesheets and Sourcemap.
gulp stylesRTL
```

## How to Update?

1. Download all the latest files in the theme folder inside the root folder of your WordPress plugin/theme by running `npx install-wpgulp` it will overwrite all the wpgulp files.
2. Open terminal and Install WPGulp's node dependencies by running the `npm install` commands in the root folder of your WordPress plugin/theme
