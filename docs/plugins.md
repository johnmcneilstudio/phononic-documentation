### Safe SVG

We need this additional functionality for images like our logo. This functionality works out-of-the-box when activated and no further action is needed.


------------------------------------
### Timber

The WordPress Timber Library allows you to write themes using the power of Twig templates. This is the core framework that we use to built the new theme. No further action is needed in order for this plugin to work.

⚠️ Please note that this plugin should be always activate in order for the new theme to work
⚠️ Please note that it may not be safe to update this plugin to the latest version of 1.14.0 directly on production. This new version of Timber introduces some major new features which might have unknown effects on your site. So it is always recommended to update this plugin on a staging environment.

### WP All Import Pro

This plugin is being used to import Uberflip content as posts. This is to allow this content to show up in search results on wordpress. The posts themselves don't have any template associated with them - if you view them, they redirect to the original page in uberflip. The importing happens automatically using cron jobs.



------------------------------------
### WP Crontrol

WP Crontrol lets you view and control what's happening in the WP-Cron system. It is always good to control the WP-Cron system through this plugin. This will help you increase the site performance.
