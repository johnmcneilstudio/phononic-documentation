# Homepage Settings

> In this section you can configure all the different sections of the homepage


This page consists of 2 different sections:

* The top portion of the site which is the splash screen including the videos and the content that is related to each individual slide/video
* The bottom section after the slides end.

Head to `Pages -> All Pages` and choose `Edit` of the homepage.


To add/edit or delete slides of the main splash screen just choose the `Sections` Tab inside the Homepage.
You can see that there are 2 fields inside each section (Title, Subtitle and Content). Please note that the different sections should match the number of the video sections otherwise, the content on the slides won't match the videos as the slides advance.

At the bottom of the same tab you can find the `Videos` and `Reverse Videos` section. Just add the videos for the respective sections. 


The second section is named `Bottom Section` and is the section that is shown once the video slides end and the user scrolls at the bottom of the page.
The options that you can configure are the image, title, subtitle and content.
