# Phononic Documentation

> This is the documentation of the Phononic Theme. This documentation covers all the required steps to get you up and running using the new theme and explains every step.



# General Settings

> In this section you can configure all the General options of the site that are applied site-wide.
> All the General Settings of the site can be found under the admin menu `Appearance -> Customize`.
> Inside this Section you can find all options separated into different sub-sections. Here are all the sub-sections: 


1. Site Identity
1. Menus
1. Widgets
1. Homepage Settings
1. Script Tags
1. Social Media Icons
1. Additional CSS - Place to add your custom CSS in case you want to override the default CSS for part of the site.


### Site Identity
-------------------

> In this section you can configure all the basic site identity options like Main Logo, Footer Logo, Site Title, etc. 


Head to `Appearance -> Customize` and then choose the `Site Identity` Menu.


Here you have tha ability to change the Site Title and Tagline, along with the site favicon.

The Site favicon can be either a GIF, PNG OR SVG and needs to be at least 512x512 px in size for pixel based image formats like GIF or PNG. SVG doesn't need any specific pixels as it is vector based format.
Of course you can use smaller resolution images like 128x128 or even 64x64 but this will make the logo more blurry and less high resolution for retina screens.

### Menus
-------------------

Here you can set your different menus that are used across the site. Currently we use 5 different menus. 
One is used in the header and it is named `Main Menu` and there are 4 others that are used at the 4 different columns in the footer of the site named `Footer Menu 1-4`

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuvQrgd?embed=true" width="250" height="780" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>


From this section you can create your different menus and you can also configure the menus from `Appearance -> Menus` as well.

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/llu4GYYL?embed=true" width="575" height="380" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>

From both within the Customizer options or Menus, you can set the order of the menu items or even delete, add or edit a menu item.

Here you can find some useful docs on how to manage your WordPress Menus:

* https://en.support.wordpress.com/menus/
* https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-navigation-menu-in-wordpress-beginners-guide/ 


 
### Widgets
--------------------

Widgets are sections across the site where you can add different Widgets to make the site more dynamic.
Currently we use 3 Widgetized areas:

* Footer Main Widget Area (Used to add all WordPress Menus or Widgets that show in the Footer section)
* Sitemap Page Widget Area (Used to add the different widgets used in the Sitemap page)
* Max Mega Menu Widgets (This is where Max Mega Menu stores widgets that you have added to sub menus using the mega menu builder. You can edit existing widgets here, but new widgets must be added through the Mega Menu interface (under Appearance > Menus).)

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/YEudnoRx?embed=true" width="575" height="380" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>

Please note that you can add pretty much everything there, from static text, images, menu items and other custom widgets.

### Homepage Settings
---------------------

The only option inside this page is to set which page will be served as the Homepage. Currently it is set to the Homepage but if you decide to create a new homepage in the future and set this new page as your Homepage, just head to this section and choose the new page from the dropdown.

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/WnuEjJxj?embed=true" width="575" height="780" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>


### Script Tags
--------------------

In this section you can configure any of the most popular script tags on your site and there is no need to do that with any 3rd party plugin.
This section supports for now the current scripts:

* Google Analytics Tracking Code
* Google Tag Manager Tracking Code
* Facebook Pixel Code

You just have to add only the unique id generated by your service and NOT the whole script tag. So for example for Google Analytics you just have to add `UA-147648636-2` and nothing else.
Everything else is done programmatically.

### Social Media Icons
----------------------


In this section you can set your social media accounts. The only option needed for every social network is the link to your official page.
The social media networks supported are the following ones:

* Facebook
* Vimeo
* Twitter
* Youtube
* Linked in

If you wish to add more social networks, this must be done programmatically as an additional request after hand-off of the project.
Please note that there is a checkbox on this section named `Show Social Media Icons` that means, even if you have your social media network links saved, these will only be visible at the footer of the site if you have this option checked.

### Additional CSS
--------------------


This section is used in case you want to override some CSS of the site and you don't want to mess with theme files.
Due to the reason that the CSS on the site is compiled into a minified version, it is always recommended if you are not a theme developer or WordPress expert in general, to not touch those files.

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/eDu9dBm6?embed=true" width="575" height="400" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>

* https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-custom-css


### Uberflip Settings
----------------------


Use this section to set the titles & icons for uberflip cards (resources). Uberflip cards will look for a matching tag on the item and use the correlated title and icon. The first item in the list is used as the default if no matching tags are found.


<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/04ugBNXx?embed=true" width="575" height="400" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>








# Pages Settings

> In this section you can configure all the static pages across the site


To configure all the other pages of the site, you just have to navigate to `Pages -> All Pages` and just choose the page that you want to modify.

If you want to create a new page just navigate to `Pages -> Add New`

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/6quLqPOZ?embed=true" width="575" height="340" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>

The editing/publishing experience of the site uses the new WordPress Editor named `Gutenberg` which provides a better publishing experience over the old WordPress WYSIWYG Editor.

<iframe src="https://share.getcloudapp.com/bLuG7wzW?embed=true" width="575" height="340" style="border:none" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">              </iframe>

# Timber Starter Theme

The "_s" for Timber: a dead-simple theme that you can build from. The primary purpose of this theme is to provide a file structure rather than a framework for markup or styles. Configure your Sass, scripts, and task runners however you would like!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timber/starter-theme.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/timber/starter-theme)

## Installing the Theme

Install this theme as you would any other, and be sure the Timber plugin is activated. But hey, let's break it down into some bullets:

1. Make sure you have installed the plugin for the [Timber Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) (and Advanced Custom Fields - they [play quite nicely](https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/acf-cookbook/#nav) together). 
2. Download the zip for this theme (or clone it) and move it to `wp-content/themes` in your WordPress installation. 
3. Rename the folder to something that makes sense for your website (generally no spaces and all lowercase). You could keep the name `timber-starter-theme` but the point of a starter theme is to make it your own!
4. Activate the theme in Appearance >  Themes.
5. Do your thing! And read [the docs](https://github.com/jarednova/timber/wiki).

## What's here?

`static/` is where you can keep your static front-end scripts, styles, or images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, fonts, and SVGs would live here.

`templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy. At the end of each PHP template, you'll notice a `Timber::render()` function whose first parameter is the Twig file where that data (or `$context`) will be used. Just an FYI.

`bin/` and `tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.

# CSS Methodologies

CSS Methodologies are a set of architectural paradigms that help avoid poor code and embraces clean and meaningful code for smaller and bigger projects

<br/>
<br/>

## ▽ ITCSS Architecture

A simple ITCSS folder structure sample.

### What is ITCSS?

> ITCSS stands for _Inverted Triangle CSS_ and it helps you to organize your project CSS files in such way that you can better **deal with** (not always easy-to-deal with) CSS specifics like **global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity**.
>
> — Lubos Kmetko, in [ITCSS: Scalable and Maintainable CSS Architecture](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)

It was created by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) and it works very well with methodologies like [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) or [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki).

Check out [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) to see the best example of ITCSS.

&nbsp;

![ITCSS Layers](https://i.imgur.com/mRQpvSj.png)

&nbsp;

### Those layers are as follows:

* **Settings** – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
* **Tools** – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
* **Generic** – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
* **Elements** – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
* **Objects** – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
* **Components** – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
* **Utilities** – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class

&nbsp;

The triangle also shows how styles represented by selectors are ordered in the resulting CSS: from generic styles to explicit ones, from low-specificity selectors to more specific ones (but still not too specific, IDs are not allowed) and from far reaching to localized ones.

## BEM Naming Methodology
BEM - Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.

### What is BEM?

BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.
<br />
<br />
The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. Using BEM’s proper naming convention will better prepare you for design changes made to your website.
<br />
